Color Game: A Fun and Challenging Color Recognition Game
Welcome to the Color Game! This is an entertaining and interactive Python application where you test your color recognition skills. Built using tkinter for the graphical user interface and sqlite3 for managing high scores, this game challenges you to quickly identify the color of the text displayed on the screen.

**How It Works**
The game displays a color name in a color that may or may not match the text itself. Your task is to type the color of the text as fast as you can. For example, if the word "Red" is displayed in blue text, you should type "Blue".

**Key Features**
Exciting Gameplay: Type the color of the text, not the word itself, to score points.
Dynamic Difficulty: The game gets more challenging as you progress.
High Score Tracking: Your highest scores are saved and displayed using an SQLite database.
Replay Option: At the end of each game, you can choose to play again or exit.

**Why Play?**
This game is perfect for sharpening your reaction time and color recognition skills while having fun. Itâ€™s also a great way to see how you stack up against your own high scores!
